IT Ticket Analysis – Data Analyst Project
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the IT support ticket management system of a corporate setup.
The goal was to study ticket resolution efficiency, agent performance, issue categories, and employee satisfaction using Excel and present actionable insights through dashboards and reports.

What I Did

Cleaned and structured the dataset of 97,498 tickets and 51 IT agents.

Categorized tickets by request type, severity, priority, and agent ID for deeper analysis.

Measured agent performance (tickets handled, resolution time, satisfaction rate).

Conducted trend analysis of ticket volumes over years and seasonal peaks.

Built Excel dashboards to visualize ticket categories, resolution distribution, and agent KPIs.

Performed a cost-benefit analysis of hiring vs. training vs. software upgrades.

Key Insights

Ticket Categories: 75% were IT Requests; 40% System issues, 30% Login, 20% Software, 10% Hardware.

Resolution Time: Avg. resolution = 4.55 days; 18% of tickets took over 9 days, impacting satisfaction.

Satisfaction: Avg. = 4.1/5; 52% high ratings, but 12% low (1–2).
